# TASK MANAGEMENT

`MONGODB | EXPRESS JS | REACT JS | NODE JS`

The website has a user-friendly interface built using React. Users can input item details like name and description. It allows users to add, edit, and delete items. These details are then sent to a backend server created with Express. The server uses a database (MongoDB) to store item information. The application's user interface dynamically updates, reflecting changes made to the items. Users can edit or remove items, which triggers requests to the server.
